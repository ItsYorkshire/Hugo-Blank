so..  
@GoHugoIO  can be a real pain if your just starting out..

Thought Id drop this #Git here that Ive just done for myself..

.. Its totally blank but set with sass conversion and css components.. you can always add JS in the assets folder if needed..

I'll be using it as a base on projects and thought it might come in handy for others.

Usage.. set up a new Hugo as you would locally and delete all the folders on your home dir except Archetypes, resources and data 

Pull this Git and copy over the folders.. oh and delete this readme..  obviously :D

As i say its a personal thing..  Might help others.. might not.

Cheers Thumbs up
